My topic is option F: Advanced Monte Carlo Rendering. And the track I implemented is improving the performance of the BVH path tracing. I followed the article “Fast Parallel Construction of High-Quality Bounding Volume Hierarchies”. However, I tried to realized a Parallel construction system but the thing I need to learn for the first time is not within the time limitation and my learning ability.. So I didn’t realize the full function out.\r\n\r\nI will introduce about the functions I have for now. The performance improving functions are based on the assignment 3. And currently all the works are in the bvh.cpp.\r\n\r\nSince we already have a basic BVH structure really from assignment 3. I started with it and tried to form the treelet structure according to the article. The overall idea is to set the number of leaf node to 7 and the internal node number to 5. While traveling through the original BVH tree. Reset the relationship of the internal node according to the SAH of every possible internal node arrangement. And let the smallest cost one to be the final internal node arrangement. While keep the relationship of the internal node and the corresponding leaf nodes.\r\n\r\nI have the following functions to realize the thought above:\r\n\r\n* getArea() \r\n\r\nInput:\r\nOutput:\r\n\r\n> get the surface area of the bounding box according to the diagonal line’s vertex.\r\n\r\n`double BVHAccel::getArea(double min_x, double max_x, double min_y, double max_y, double min_z, double max_z)`\r\n`{`\r\n  `double dx = max_x - min_x;`\r\n  `double dy = max_y - min_y;`\r\n  `double dz = max_z - min_z;`\r\n  `return 2 * (dx * dy + dx * dz + dy * dz);`\r\n`}`\r\n\r\n* mergeBox()\r\n\r\nInput: bounding box1, bounding box2, bounding box3\r\nOutput: void\r\n\r\nreset the bounding box3’s attributes using the smallest and largest attributes from bounding box1 and bounding box2.\r\n\r\n* getTreelet()\r\n\r\n* updateNewCost()\r\n\r\nInput: root of the BVH\r\nOutput: void\r\n\r\nfor all the node in the tree\r\n    calculate the cost of each node according to it's children's cost\r\nend\r\n\r\n* updateNewArea()\r\n\r\nInput: root of the BVH\r\nOutput: void\r\n\r\nfor all the node in the tree\r\n    calculate the area of each leaf node\r\n    let the parent internal node go to lower level \r\nend\r\n\r\n* rebuiltBVH()\r\n\r\n* treeletOptimize()\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
