And the track I implemented is improving the performance of the BVH path tracing. I followed the article _“Fast Parallel Construction of High-Quality Bounding Volume Hierarchies”_. However, I tried to realize a Parallel construction system but since I'm new to the area I didn't make it. So I didn’t realize the full function out.\r\n\r\nI will introduce the functions I have for now. The performance improving functions are based on the assignment 3. And currently all the works are done in the bvh.cpp.\r\n\r\nSince we already have a basic BVH structure ready from assignment 3. I started with it and tried to form the treelet structure according to the article. The overall idea is: For each node, set the number of leaf node to 7 and the internal node number to 5. While traveling through the original BVH tree. Rearrange the relationship of the \"internal node\" according to the new SAH cost of every possible arrangement. And let the smallest cost one to be the final internal node arrangement, keeping the relationship of the internal node and the corresponding leaf nodes.\r\n\r\nI have the following functions to realize the thought above:\r\n\r\n* getArea() \r\n    * Input: the maximum and minimum value of the vertex.\r\n    * Output: the surface area.\r\n\r\n> get the surface area of the bounding box according to the diagonal line’s vertex.\r\n\r\n```\r\ndouble getArea(double min_x, double max_x, double min_y, double max_y, double min_z, double max_z) {\r\n  double dx = max_x - min_x;\r\n  double dy = max_y - min_y;\r\n  double dz = max_z - min_z;\r\n  return 2 * (dx * dy + dx * dz + dy * dz);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* mergeBox()\r\n    * Input: bounding box1, bounding box2, bounding box3\r\n    * Output: void\r\n\r\n> reset the bounding box3’s attributes using the smallest and largest attributes from bounding box1 and bounding box2.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid mergeBox(BBox& b1, BBox& b2, BBox* b3) {\r\n   b3->min.x = std::min(b1.min.x, b2.min.x);\r\n   b3->max.x = std::max(b1.max.x, b2.max.x);\r\n   b3->min.y = std::min(b1.min.y, b2.min.y);\r\n   b3->max.y = std::max(b1.max.y, b2.max.y);\r\n   b3->min.z = std::min(b1.min.z, b2.min.z);\r\n   b3->max.z = std::max(b1.max.z, b2.max.z);\r\n   return;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* optimizeTreelet()\r\n    * Input: the number of the leaves\r\n    * Output: void\r\n\r\n> rearrange the leaves' partition to get the smallest cost arrangement\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid optimizeTreelet(int n, std::vector<BVHNode *> leaves) {\r\n  int num_subsets = pow(2, n) - 1;\r\n\r\n  double area[128];\r\n  double c_opt[128];\r\n\r\n  // Calculate surface area for each subset\r\n  for (int s = 1; s <= num_subsets; s++) {\r\n    area[s] = get_total_area(n, leaves, s);\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Initialize costs of individual leaves\r\n  for (int i = 0; i <= (n-1); i++) {\r\n    c_opt[pow(2, i)] = leaves[i]->cost;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // Optimize every arrangement of leaves\r\n  for (unsigned k = 2; k <= n; k++) {\r\n    for (unsigned char s = 1; s <= num_subsets; s++) {\r\n        // Try each way of partitioning the leaves\r\n        double c_s = INF_D;\r\n        unsigned char p_s = 0;\r\n        unsigned char d = (s - 1) & s;\r\n        unsigned char p = (-d) & s;\r\n        while (p != 0) {\r\n          float c = c_opt[p] + c_opt[s ^ p];\r\n          if (c < c_s) {\r\n              c_s = c;\r\n              p_s = p;\r\n          }\r\n          \r\n          p = (p - d) & s;\r\n        }\r\n        // Calculate final SAH cost\r\n        c_opt[s] = 1.2 * a[s] + c_s;\r\n        p_opt[s] = p_s;\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* updateCost()\r\n\r\n    * Input: node from the BVH\r\n    * Output: void\r\n\r\n> for the node in the tree calculate the cost of each node according to it's children's cost\r\n\r\n```\r\nvoid updateCost(BVHNode *root, std::vector<BVHNode *>leaves, int num_leaves) {\r\n\r\n    for (int i = 0; i < num_leaves; i++) {\r\n        BVHNode *cur = leaves[i];\r\n        cur = cur->p;\r\n        while (cur != root) {\r\n            if (cur->cost == 0.0) {\r\n                if (cur->left->cost != 0.0 && cur->right->cost != 0.0) {\r\n                    // Both left & right propagated\r\n                    BBox *bb_cur = &cur->bound;\r\n                    merge_bounds(cur->l->bb, cur->right->bb, bb_cur);\r\n                    cur->cost = Ct * cur->bb->surface_area() + cur->left->cost + cur->right->cost;\r\n                } else {\r\n                    // Only one side propagated\r\n                    break;\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            cur = cur->p;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Cost of the root\r\n    BBox *bbox = &root->bb;\r\n    merge_bounds(root->l->bb, root->r->bb, bbox);\r\n    // root->area = getArea(bound->min_x, bound->max_x, bound->min_y,\r\n    //     bound->max_y, bound->min_z, bound->max_z);\r\n    root->cost = Ct * root->bb->surface_area() + root->l->cost + root->r->cost;\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n* updateNewArea()\r\n\r\nInput: root of the BVH\r\nOutput: void\r\n\r\nfor all the node in the tree\r\n    calculate the area of each leaf node\r\n    let the parent internal node go to lower level \r\nend\r\n\r\n* rebuiltBVH()\r\n\r\n* treeletOptimize()","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
