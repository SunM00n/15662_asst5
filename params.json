My topic is option F: Advanced Monte Carlo Rendering. And the track I implemented is improving the performance of the BVH path tracing. I followed the article “Fast Parallel Construction of High-Quality Bounding Volume Hierarchies”. However, I tried to realized a Parallel construction system but the thing I need to learn for the first time is not within the time limitation and my learning ability.. So I didn’t realize the full function out.\r\n\r\nI will introduce about the functions I have for now. The performance improving functions are based on the assignment 3. And currently all the works are in the bvh.cpp.\r\n\r\nSince we already have a basic BVH structure really from assignment 3. I started with it and tried to form the treelet structure according to the article. The overall idea is to set the number of leaf node to 7 and the internal node number to 5. While traveling through the original BVH tree. Reset the relationship of the internal node according to the SAH of every possible internal node arrangement. And let the smallest cost one to be the final internal node arrangement. While keep the relationship of the internal node and the corresponding leaf nodes.\r\n\r\nI have the following functions to realize the thought above:","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
